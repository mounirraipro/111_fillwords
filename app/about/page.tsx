                <h2>Our Story</h2>
                <p>
                    FillWords was born from a simple idea: what if word search puzzles could be more engaging,
                    more strategic, and more satisfying? The result is a game where you swipe through grids of
                    letters to uncover hidden words — an experience that&apos;s instantly intuitive yet endlessly
                    rewarding.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We launched FillWords with a clear vision — to create a free, accessible, and beautifully
                    designed word puzzle game that anyone can enjoy. Whether you&apos;re a student taking a study break, a
                    professional unwinding after work, or a parent looking for screen time that&apos;s actually
                    beneficial for your kids, FillWords has something for you.
                </p>

                <h2>Our Mission</h2>
                <p>
                    We believe that word games are more than entertainment — they&apos;re tools for building
                    vocabulary, improving focus, and finding moments of calm in a busy world. Our mission
                    is to make high-quality word puzzle experiences freely available to everyone, everywhere.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Every puzzle in FillWords is handcrafted with care. From curating the perfect word lists to
                    fine-tuning the difficulty progression, we obsess over the details so you can simply enjoy
                    the puzzles.

                <h2>What Makes Us Different</h2>
                <p>
                    Unlike traditional word search games, FillWords uses a swipe-to-connect mechanic. Instead
                    of circling words in a grid full of random letters, every letter belongs to exactly one word.
                    You trace paths through adjacent letters to spell words, and as you find them, the grid
                    gradually clears — creating a satisfying sense of progress as you solve the puzzle.
