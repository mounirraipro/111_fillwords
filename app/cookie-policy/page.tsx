                <h2>What Are Cookies?</h2>
                <p>
                    Cookies are small text files that are placed on your device (computer, smartphone, or
                    tablet) when you visit a website. They are widely used to make websites work efficiently
                    and provide information to the site owners. Cookies can be &ldquo;persistent&rdquo; (they remain on
                    your device until deleted) or &ldquo;session&rdquo; cookies (they are deleted when you close your browser).
                </p>

                <h2>How We Use Cookies</h2>
                <p>FillWords uses cookies for the following purposes:</p>
