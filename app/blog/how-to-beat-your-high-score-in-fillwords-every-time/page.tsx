                    You have learned the rules. You can clear a beginner board. You are consistently finding the hidden words. But when you look at the master leaderboards or watch a seasoned player slice through an 8x8 grid in 90 seconds, you realize you are missing something fundamental.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Hitting a high score in FillWords is not about knowing more obscurities from the dictionary; it is about playing efficiently. To beat your personal best, you must stop treating the game as a casual word search and start treating it as a mathematical optimization problem. Here are the elite strategies to maximize your FillWords score.
                </p>

                <h2>1. The 'Vowel Siphoning' Mistake</h2>
                <p>
                    The most common mistake intermediate players make is aggressively pursuing easy, short words without considering the remaining board state. Words like "AREA" or "IDEA" use a disproportionate number of vowels relative to consonants.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Elite Strategy:</strong> Hoard your vowels. Before you swipe a vowel-heavy word, check the surrounding letters. If you leave a clump of five consonants (like B, G, K, P, T) isolated in a corner without access to an A, E, I, O, or U, you have irreparably bricked your board. Elite players often delay solving short, obvious words to ensure they have the necessary vowels to weave through dense consonant clusters later.
                </p>

                <h2>2. Working Backwards from Uncommon Letters</h2>
                <p>
                    English relies heavily on an expected distribution of letters. Vowels are common; letters like Q, Z, J, X, and V are rare.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Elite Strategy:</strong> Anchor your visual search around the rarest letters on the board. A "Z" limits your vocabulary options drastically. Therefore, identifying the path involving the "Z" immediately eliminates a huge chunk of uncertainty on the board. Work backward from the rare letter to find the root word, rather than aimlessly scanning the common letters hoping a word magically appears.
                </p>

                <h2>3. Corner Isolation (The "Choke Point")</h2>
                <p>
                    In Fillwords, a corner letter has only three possible connections. This makes it a structural "choke point."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Elite Strategy:</strong> The first words you solve should almost always incorporate the four extreme corners of the grid. If you solve out the middle of the board first, you severely limit the possible directional paths for the remaining corner letters, dramatically increasing your chances of an unsolvable board state and forcing costly "Undos" which drain your high score timer.
                </p>

                <h2>4. The "Longest Path First" Rule</h2>
                <p>
                    Many point systems reward longer words exponentially. Furthermore, finding a long word structurally simplifies the remaining board much faster than finding several short words.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Elite Strategy:</strong> Actively search for affixes. If you spot an "-ATION" or an "UN-" prefix, trace the path to see how far you can extend it. A single 9-letter word clears significantly more real estate and scores higher than three 3-letter words, and it reduces the overall cognitive load required to solve the remaining puzzle.
                </p>

                <h2>5. Mastering the "Look-Ahead"</h2>
                <p>
                    Just as chess grandmasters think three moves ahead, FillWords masters practice the "look-ahead."
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>The Elite Strategy:</strong> Before you finalize a swipe, pause for half a second. Look at the letters that will immediately surround the empty space you are about to create. Can those remaining letters still form a valid connective path? If swiping "BEAR" isolates a "Q" with no "U" nearby, abort the swipe and find an alternative path for "BEAR".
                </p>

                <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                <p>
                    Speed in FillWords does not come from moving your finger faster; it comes from moving your eyes smarter. By prioritizing rare letters, protecting your vowels, and managing your corners, you transition from relying on luck to relying on algorithmic logic. Apply these five principles, and watch your personal best scores skyrocket.
